[{"content":"Introduction The motivation for creating StyleGAN started from some issues with GANs. While GANs have a structure that can generate high-quality images, they face big challenges in controlling detailed styles or elements of the image. For example, in previous GAN models, even if they generate a person’s face, there were many limits in adjusting small details or styles of that face .\nStyleGAN aims to overcome these limits of regular GAN models and achieve both control over image generation and high-quality, detailed images. StyleGAN’s goal is to create images that are more realistic and controllable. To achieve this, StyleGAN\u0026rsquo;s design borrwed ideas from style transfer literature and added mechanisms to mix different styles.\nBasic Concepts of GANs and Limitations of Existing Models To better understand StyleGAN, this section will provide a brief explanation of its predecessors, GAN and Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN) \u0026hellip;..\nGAN and Its Basic Structure GANs have a structure of two networks, the Generator and the Discriminator ,which compete and improve together. The Generator takes random noise as input to create fake images, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. Through their Adverisal interaction in training, the Generator gradually improves and creates images that look more and more real.\nFig. 1. Architecture of a generative adversarial network.

G(generator) tries to trick the discriminator. Otherwise D(discriminator) works hard not to be fooled.\nIn other words, D and G are playing a minmax game to optimize the following loss function: Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) DCGAN is a model that starts with a latent vector and progressively upsamples it through a convolutional network. This approach has improved performance in the image domain. By using transposed convolutions, DCGAN effectively increases the image resolution, step by step. With this structure, vector arithmetic became possible, leading to advancements in GANs that aimed to control semantic information within images.\nFig. 2. Architecture of a DCGAN.

Instead of creating high-resolution images all at once, this method ensures stability by incrementally adding layers during training.\nFig. 3. Architecture of a PGGAN. (Image source: [https://python.plainenglish.io/a-friendly-introduction-to-generative-adversarial-networks-gans-101f8de8d3b6])\nPGGAN applied WGAN-GP Loss to improve training stability, making it possible to generate high-resolution images. However, it had limitations in controlling specific details or styles within the images.\nMain Idea of StyleGAN There are several reasons why AI models hallucinate:\nTraining Data Quality: If the model’s training data is incomplete or inaccurate, it may lack the necessary information to generate factually correct responses. Over-reliance on Pattern Recognition: Models are optimized to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses rather than true or accurate ones. Bias in Training Data: If the training data contains biases, the model may produce biased or incorrect information, perpetuating existing inaccuracies.

Below is a sample Python function for verifying the accuracy of a statement using a hypothetical fact-checking API.\nThe SAFE evaluation metric is F1 @ K. The motivation is that model response for long-form factuality should ideally hit both precision and recall, as the response should be both\nfactual: measured by precision, the percentage of supported facts among all facts in the entire response. long: measured by recall, the percentage of provided facts among all relevant facts that should appear in the response. Therefore we want to consider the number of supported facts up to K. Given the model response y, the metric F1 @ K is defined as:\n","permalink":"https://mscho2008.github.io/posts/stylegan/","summary":"A deep dive into the phenomenon of hallucinations in AI models, exploring causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies.","title":"StyleGAN : A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks"}]
