[{"content":"Introduction Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating text that resembles human language, but they also exhibit a concerning behavior: hallucination. Hallucination occurs when an AI model generates information that sounds plausible but is actually incorrect or fabricated. Understanding the causes and solutions to hallucination is crucial as AI models become more integrated into critical applications.\ncopy? Hallucination in AI refers to instances where a model produces responses not based on factual data or real-world knowledge. For example, when asked about a fictional event, an AI might fabricate a plausible-sounding answer rather than admitting it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know. This can mislead users, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare or law.\nExample Image of Hallucination In this image, the AI model confidently provides an answer to a question based on nonexistent information, illustrating a typical hallucination case.\nCauses of Hallucination There are several reasons why AI models hallucinate:\nTraining Data Quality: If the modelâ€™s training data is incomplete or inaccurate, it may lack the necessary information to generate factually correct responses. Over-reliance on Pattern Recognition: Models are optimized to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses rather than true or accurate ones. Bias in Training Data: If the training data contains biases, the model may produce biased or incorrect information, perpetuating existing inaccuracies. Fig. 3.

Below is a sample Python function for verifying the accuracy of a statement using a hypothetical fact-checking API.\nThe SAFE evaluation metric is F1 @ K. The motivation is that model response for long-form factuality should ideally hit both precision and recall, as the response should be both\nfactual: measured by precision, the percentage of supported facts among all facts in the entire response. long: measured by recall, the percentage of provided facts among all relevant facts that should appear in the response. Therefore we want to consider the number of supported facts up to K. Given the model response y, the metric F1 @ K is defined as:\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/stylegan/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating text that resembles human language, but they also exhibit a concerning behavior: \u003cstrong\u003ehallucination\u003c/strong\u003e.
